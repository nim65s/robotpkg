gz-cmake provides a set of cmake modules that are used by the C++ based Gazebo
projects. These modules help to control the quality and consistency of the
Gazebo projects build systems.

These modules are tailored to the Gazebo projects, so their use for non-Gazebo
projects might be limited, but they may serve as a useful reference for setting
up a modern cmake build system using good practices.
