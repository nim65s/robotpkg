Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2.0 is a cross-platform library for Intel® RealSense™
depth cameras.

The SDK allows depth and color streaming, and provides intrinsic and extrinsic
calibration information. The library also offers synthetic streams (pointcloud,
depth aligned to color and vise-versa), and a built-in support for record and
playback of streaming sessions.
