Gazebo Sim is an open source robotics simulator. Through Gazebo Sim, users have
access to high fidelity physics, rendering, and sensor models. Additionally,
users and developers have multiple points of entry to simulation including a
graphical user interface, plugins, and asynchronous message passing and
services.

Gazebo Sim is derived from Gazebo Classic and represents over 16 years of
development and experience in robotics and simulation. This library is part of
the Gazebo project.
