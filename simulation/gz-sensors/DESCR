Gazebo Sensors, a component of Gazebo, provides numerous sensor models designed
to generate realistic data from simulation environments. Gazebo Sensors is used
in conjunction with Gazebo Libraries, and especially relies on the rendering
capabilities from Gazebo Rendering and physics simulation from Gazebo Physics.
