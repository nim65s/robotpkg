Generic genom3 camera interface for image acquisition.

Multiple image (multiple out) output ports can be published, organized into
individual banks. Each bank contains a number of coherent images, e.g. time
synchronized.

The internal architecture implements a graph of named source and sink slots,
which can be published individually into images of a bank. Hardware-dependent
functions can stream raw data into slots, which can then filtered or otherwise
processed by generic services into other slots and eventually published.
