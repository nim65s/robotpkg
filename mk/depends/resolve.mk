# An example package depend.mk file:
#
# -------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------
# DEPEND_DEPTH:=	${DEPEND_DEPTH}+
# FOO_DEPEND_MK:=	${FOO_DEPEND_MK}+
#
# ifeq (+,$(DEPEND_DEPTH))
# DEPEND_PKG+=		foo
# endif
#
# ifeq (+,$(FOO_DEPEND_MK))
# DEPEND_USE+=		foo
# DEPEND_DIR.foo?=	../../category/foo
# endif  # FOO_DEPEND_MK
#
# include ../../category/baz/depend.mk
#
# DEPEND_DEPTH:=	${DEPEND_DEPTH:+=}
# -------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------8<-------------
#
# Most of the depend.mk file is protected against multiple inclusion,
# except for the parts related to manipulating DEPEND_DEPTH.
#
# Note that if a depend.mk file is included, then the package Makefile
# has the expectation that it can use the value of PREFIX.<pkg>.
# If the depend.mk tries to handle dependencies satisfied directly by
# the base system, then it should provide an appropriate value for
# PREFIX.<pkg> for that case.  The case where a dependency is
# satisfied by a robotpkg-installed package is handled automatically by
# this file.
#
# The different variables that may be set in a depend.mk file are
# described below.
#
# The variable name convention used in this Makefile are:
#
# DEPEND_*	public variables usable in other Makefiles
# _DPD_*	private variables to this Makefile


# DEPEND_PKG contains the list of packages for which we add a direct
# dependency.
#
DEPEND_PKG?=# empty

# DEPEND_USE contains the full list of packages on which we have a
# dependency (direct or indirect).
#
DEPEND_USE?=# empty

# By default, prefer the robotpkg version of all packages. Individual
# packages might override this, and users can set their preferences in
# robotpkg.conf.
