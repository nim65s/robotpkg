Gazebo Math, a component of Gazebo, provides general purpose math classes and
functions designed for robotic applications.

Gazebo Math provides a wide range of functionality, including:
* Type-templated pose, matrix, vector, and quaternion classes.
* Shape representations along with operators to compute volume, density, size
  and other properties.
* Classes for material properties, mass, inertial, temperature, PID, kmeans,
  spherical coordinates, and filtering.
* Optional Eigen component that converts between a few Eigen and Gazebo Math
  types.
